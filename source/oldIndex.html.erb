          <h2>My Stack</h2>
          <h5>I studied programming at
            <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo" class="link" target="_blank">Le Wagon Tokyo</a>. Where I learned OOP with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQLite, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS3, JS and libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery...), and React. So my stack looks like this:

            <h5>I was the lead dev on this project. We made a calendar application to help DM's and players
              connect, keep track of time, and take notes about their
              campaigns. The app has pre-made calendar templates for
              different fantasy settings (such as Eberron) seeded with
              cultural events and holidays. I personally wrote the chrome
              extension so players could add notes to their calendars
              without leaving their VTTP's.

              <h5>This was a solo project I did. I made an application for ranking and reviewing D&D
                spells. I thought it might be fun to have a constantly up-to-date place for players to go see how other players feel
                about different spells. Thinking of adding a new section
                specifically for people's opinions about what spells to
                take at which level for each class.
